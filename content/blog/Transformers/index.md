### What is the Transformer Model Actually ?
The Transformer, with its parallel processing capabilities, allowed for more efficient and scalable models, making it easier to train them on large datasets. It also demonstrated superior performance in several NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis and text generation tasks. The Transformer model has since become the foundation for many state-of-the-art NLP models, such as BERT, GPT-2, and T5.


### Components of the Transformer Architecture 
The Transformer consists of two main components the Encoder and the Decoder. The Encoder processes the input and converts it into a numerical representation that the model can understand. The Decoder then takes this representation and generates the output sequence, when this paper was first introduced it solved the task of translation
